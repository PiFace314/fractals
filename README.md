# Fractals
A visual app that lets you see fractals and how they work in an interactive way.

#

This app is built with LÃ–VE 0.10.2. It consists of a very simple initial menu that lets you choose one of the available fractals. There are currently 8 working fractals, and one work-in-progress fractal, the Apollonian Gasket.

In order to show in practice the recursive nature of the fractals, I tried to build them using recursive functions only.
